## 🎯 Growth Philosophy

**ForkMonkey is a product-led growth play.**

- The product IS the marketing (forking = viral loop)
- Every user is a potential influencer (their monkey is content)
- Social proof is built-in (stars, forks, leaderboard)

Our job: **Remove friction and amplify signals.**

## 📧 Outreach Templates

### Developer Influencer Outreach

**Subject:** Weirdest GitHub project for your next video?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Loved your [specific video/post about X]. The part about [specific detail] really resonated.

I built something weird: ForkMonkey – a digital pet that lives in a GitHub repo and evolves daily with AI.

Quick demo: [30-sec video link]

It's getting traction (~500 forks) and I think your audience would love either:
1. A "code review" of the evolution system
2. A "let's see what happens" breeding stream
3. Just a quick showcase

Either way, happy to hop on a call and walk you through it. Or just fork it and play around: github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey

No pressure – just thought it'd make fun content.

Cheers,
[Name]
```

### Newsletter Submission

**Subject:** Submission: AI-powered digital pets on GitHub

**Body:**
```
Hi [Newsletter Name] team,

I'd like to submit ForkMonkey for consideration.

**One-liner:** Digital pets that live in GitHub repos and evolve daily using AI.

**What it is:**
- Fork a repo to adopt a unique monkey
- AI (GitHub Models, free) evolves it every day
- Forking = breeding with genetic inheritance
- Community leaderboard by rarity

**Why it's interesting:**
- Novel use of GitHub Actions as autonomous AI agent
- $0 to run forever (serverless + free AI tier)
- Already trending with 500+ forks

**Links:**
- Repo: github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey
- Web: [live demo]
- Technical writeup: [blog post]

Let me know if you need more info!

Best,
[Name]
```

### Tech Press Pitch

**Subject:** Story idea: GitHub's free AI creates "living" digital collectibles

**Body:**
```
Hi [Reporter],

I saw your piece on [relevant article] – great coverage of [aspect].

I've built something that might interest you: ForkMonkey, a digital collectible system that's:

**The hook:** The first truly autonomous, self-evolving digital "life" that costs $0 to run.

**How it works:**
- Digital "pets" live in GitHub repos

**Why now:**
- GitHub just launched free AI access (GitHub Models)
- NFT interest is shifting to "utility" collectibles
- Developer culture loves weird experiments

**Traction:** 500+ forks, trending on GitHub, active community.

Would you be interested in covering this? I can offer:
- Exclusive interview
- Behind-the-scenes technical deep-dive

Happy to chat whenever works.
