🐵 Just forked my first ForkMonkey

It's a Tamagotchi that lives in a GitHub repo and evolves daily with AI.

Completely free. Forever on GitHub.

Fork yours: github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey

#OpenSource #AI #GitHub
```

```
Day 47 🐵

My ForkMonkey just evolved SUNGLASSES

Rarity score: 67/100 (up from 45!)

This AI evolution thing is addictive ngl

Still free: github.com/[username]/forkMonkey
```

```
🧵 Wild experiment:

I made a pet that:
- Lives in a GitHub repo
- Evolves daily with AI
- Breeds through forking
- Costs $0 forever

Here's what happened after 1000 forks...
```

### LinkedIn
```
🐵 Launched a new side project this week: ForkMonkey

What is it?
A digital pet that lives entirely on GitHub, evolves daily using AI (GitHub Models), and "breeds" through forking.

Why build this?
- Exploring what "serverless AI agents" can do
- Making open source more engaging
- Having fun with GitHub's free tier

Lessons learned:
1. GitHub Actions + AI = Powerful autonomous agents
2. Gamification works even for developers
3. Sometimes the weird ideas are the best ones

Try it (free): github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey

What's the weirdest thing you've built?

Title: I built a Tamagotchi that lives in a GitHub repo and evolves with AI – completely free

---

**TL;DR:** Fork a repo, get a unique digital pet, watch it evolve daily via AI.

Been working on this experiment called **ForkMonkey**. It's basically:

- A digital pet stored as JSON in your repo
- An AI (GitHub Models, free) that evolves its appearance daily
- A genetics system where forking = breeding

**No servers. No API keys. No cost. Just GitHub Actions doing the work.**

How it works:
1. Fork the repo
2. Enable GitHub Actions  
3. Your monkey starts evolving every night

The genetics part is fun – when someone forks your monkey, their child inherits 50% of your traits + random mutations.

There's already a community of ~200 monkeys forming a family tree across GitHub.

Repo: https://github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey

Would love feedback. Is this interesting or am I just weird? 😅
```

### Hacker News
```
Title: Show HN: A Tamagotchi that lives in a GitHub repo and evolves with AI

---

I built ForkMonkey – an experiment in "autonomous agents" using only free GitHub infrastructure.

What it does:
- A digital pet (JSON state + SVG visualization) lives in your repo
- Every night, a GitHub Action wakes up and asks GPT-4o (via GitHub Models) how the pet should evolve
- Forking the repo = breeding a new monkey that inherits traits

Tech stack: Python, GitHub Actions, GitHub Models (free AI tier), SVG generation

Why? I wanted to see if you could create a "living" system that costs $0 to run indefinitely. The answer is yes.

The interesting bit: since forking is the breeding mechanism, every new user automatically extends the family tree. It's created a network of ~200 monkeys with visible lineages.

Repo: https://github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey

Happy to answer questions about the architecture!

Subject: Weirdest GitHub project you'll see today?

Hey [Name],

Love your content on [specific video/post].

I built something weird and thought you'd either love it or think I've lost my mind:

**ForkMonkey** – A Tamagotchi that lives in a GitHub repo.

- Evolves daily using AI (GitHub Models, free)
- Breeds through forking
- Costs $0 forever
- ~200 monkeys already in the wild

30-second demo: [video link]
Repo: github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey

Would make a fun video/stream topic. Let me know if you want to dive deeper – happy to hop on a call.

Cheers,

**Why readers will care:**
- Novel use of GitHub Actions as a serverless AI agent
- Completely free (GitHub Models + Actions)
- Fun way to learn about genetics systems
- Already trending with 200+ forks

### To Tech Press
```
Subject: Exclusive: GitHub's free AI tier powers "living" digital pets

Hi [Reporter name],

I noticed you covered [relevant article]. Thought you might find this interesting:

I built **ForkMonkey** – digital collectibles that live on GitHub and evolve daily using AI.

**The angle:** This is the first example of a truly decentralized, autonomous "digital life" that costs nothing to run. It uses GitHub's new free AI tier + Actions to create something that:

1. Lives forever (as long as GitHub exists)
2. Evolves autonomously (AI decides daily changes)
3. Breeds through forking (genetics system)
4. Costs $0 (no servers, no API costs)

It's being compared to a "free, open-source alternative to NFT collectibles" but with actual life-like behavior.

**Stats:** 200+ forks, trending on GitHub, community forming around breeding strategies.

Would you be interested in covering this? Happy to provide exclusive demo, interview, or early access to upcoming features.

Best,
[Your name]

## 🎯 Conversion Funnel Optimization

### Awareness → Interest
**Problem:** User doesn't understand what ForkMonkey is
**Solution:** One-liner + visual demo

```
BEFORE: "ForkMonkey is an AI-powered digital collectible that lives on GitHub"
AFTER:  "Fork a repo. Get a pet. Watch it evolve with AI every night."
```

### Interest → Decision
**Problem:** User unsure if worth the effort
**Solution:** Show instant value + social proof

```
Add to hero:
"⚡ Takes 30 seconds to start"
"🌳 Join 234 monkey families"
"💸 Completely free, no catch"
```

### Decision → Action
**Problem:** Too many steps, friction
**Solution:** Single clear CTA, reduce options

```
BEFORE: [Read Docs] [View Demo] [Fork Repo] [See Community]
AFTER:  [🐵 Fork Your Monkey – Free] 
        (smaller: See community monkeys →)
```

### Action → Retention
**Problem:** User forgets to check back
**Solution:** Daily evolution notification + streak

```
GitHub Actions summary:
"✨ Your monkey evolved! New trait: SUNGLASSES"
"🔥 7-day streak! Keep the evolution going!"
"📊 You're now #47 on the leaderboard (up 12 spots)"
```

## 💬 Objection Handling

### "What's the point?"
> It's like a Tamagotchi meets NFTs – but free and actually alive. Your monkey evolves every day, and watching what AI does to it is genuinely fun. Plus, the family tree across GitHub is growing into something unexpectedly cool.

### "Do I need to do anything?"
> Nope! Once you fork and enable Actions, it evolves automatically every night. Check in whenever you want to see what changed.

### "Is this an NFT thing?"
> No blockchain, no crypto, no cost. It's just a fun experiment in what you can do with GitHub and AI. You truly own it – it lives in your repo.

### "Why would I fork someone else's monkey?"
> Genetics! When you fork, your monkey inherits traits from the parent + gets random mutations. It's like breeding Pokémon but on GitHub.

### "What if GitHub shuts down?"
> Your monkey data is in your repo – you could host it anywhere. But GitHub isn't going anywhere, and your monkey will outlive us all. 🐵
